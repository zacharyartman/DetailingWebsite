# Sea Isles Auto Detailing Website

## Introduction
This repository contains the code for my detailing website, originally hosted at [seaislesdetailing.weebly.com](https://seaislesdetailing.weebly.com). It includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for various pages like contact, detailing services, exterior and interior detailing, and more.

## Installation
Clone the repository using: `git clone https://github.com/zacharyartman/DetailingWebsite.git`

## Usage
To view the website locally, open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
To view the website in your browser, go to [zacharyartman.com/detailing](https://zacharyartman.com/detailing).

## Note on Local Usage
When opening the project locally, please note that the navigation buttons may not function as expected. This is because the `href` attributes in the HTML are set up with paths like `contact` instead of `contact.html`. This design choice is intended to hide the `.html` extension in the browser URL when the site is hosted online.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome. Please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes.
